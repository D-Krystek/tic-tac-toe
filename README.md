# tic-tac-toe
A learning project where I make a playable tic tac toe game, apply different algorithms to play as an opponent, and learn the basics of GUI. 

The end goals are:
~~1. Have a working tic tac toe game~~

2. Create a minimax algorithm to play tic tac toe
3. Create a genetic algorithm to play tic tac toe
4. Create a machine learning algorithm
5. Create a functioning GUI to make the game easier to play and show AI thinking
